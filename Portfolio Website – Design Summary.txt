Team Name: Ping³
Project Year: 2025
Project Type: Multi-page Personal Portfolio (Web Design Assignment)

Layout Choices

We followed a clean, responsive layout using standard HTML5 and CSS. The structure includes:

* Navigation bar at the top for smooth page access.
* Hero section with a powerful visual hook on the homepage.
* Project showcase grid in the portfolio for clean display.
* Modular sections for easy readability (e.g., About, Contact, Blog).
* Footer includes social links and copyright.

All pages share a consistent structure for uniformity.

Color Palette

We used a modern and professional color scheme:

* Primary Color: Deep Midnight Blue (#020c1b) – for the background
* Accent Colors: Neon Aqua (#00d1ff), Light Gray (#e0e0e0) – for highlights and text
* Contrast: White and bright accents to ensure readability and accessibility

The palette enhances the AI/digital theme and keeps the UI sleek.
